<h2 class="sub-heading">What is Alastair</h2>
	<p>Alastair is an app, with that you can create food plans for events (projects). It works in two layers: </p>
	<p>At first there are <b>receipes and ingredients</b>. This layer is applicable for all the projects, meaning if you create a new project, available receipes and ingredients won't change. Each ingredient has a price, which usually is quite tricky to find out (we went to Aldi and copied the prices from the shelves), but as soon as we have a database, we can use it for all the events. Also, sometimes it is problematic to classify the quantities: in the receipe it may say 100 gram of apples, but you can only buy 12 pieces at once. For this, there is the <span class="important">Calculation Measurement</span>, which can be used as an alternative measurement in the ingredient. But the two measurements available in one ingredient should refer to the same item, meaning if you can buy 2kg of apples, you should put the count of apples in <b>2kg</b> as calculation measurement!</p>
	<p>Then, there is the project specific layer, which is only visible when a project is activated. Here, you can define meals which consist of receipes and a person count. So if you want to add a dinner, you can easily change the number of persons you want to cook for. If you want to cook different meals for dinner, like one vegetarian and one omnivor one, you can simply add multiple receipes to the meal, but remember to insert the correct person counts then (you will need to know how many vegetarians there are)</p>
	<p>The really useful thing then is the point <span class="important">Shopping List</span>. Here you can see an autogenerated shopping list for the event: For this, all the ingredients in all the meals are summed up to a <span class="important">Exact Amount</span> of the ingredient. But as you can not buy half a potato, the app also shows an <span class="important">Effective Amount</span>, meaning the amount you can effectively buy in the supermarket. If you already bought something or did good FR, you can add it to the <span class="important">Inventory</span> and it will be excluded from the shopping list</p>
	<p>I am always happy if someone is motivated to help me with the project, check out the <a href="https://github.com/blacksph3re/alastair">github project</a> or contact me!</p>
